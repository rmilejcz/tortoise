# Tortoise

Native UNIX commands implemented in Go and heavily inspired by ShellJS

## Why?

Partly because a need arose, but also for fun! I started programming in JavaScript before I ever even knew what Go was and I'm a big of shell scripting to help automate tasks. As I became more and more familiar with Go and abandoned Node entirely, I found it difficult to phase out usage of gulp / ShellJS in part because no Go library (to my knowledge) offered simple access to utilities such as `sed` that work on any platform. I also thought this would be a great way to familiarize embolden my Go knowledge, and hopefully get some feedback on my Go code quality.

## Why is it called tortoise?

Because `gopher-tortoise-shell` is too long
